Description: 
        The aim of caspo is to implement a pipeline for automated reasoning on logical signaling networks. 
        Main features include, learning of logical networks from experiments, design new experiments in 
        order to reduce the uncertainty, and finding intervention strategies to control the biological system.

        ------------------
        - Complete refactoring (no backwards compatibility)
        - Introduce subcommands: 
            - learn: learning logical networks
            - control: finding intervention strategies
            - analyze: compute I/O behaviors and basic stats
            - design: experimental design to discriminate I/O behaviors
            - visualize: dump results from other subcommands to dot files
        - Uses latest potassco tools: clingo >= 4.3.0, gringo >= 4.3.0 and clasp >= 3.0.2
