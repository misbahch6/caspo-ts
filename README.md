# Caspo-ts (Caspo Time Series)
Caspo-ts is a software to infer Boolean Networks from prior knowledge network and phosphoproteomic time series data. This software is based on Answer Set Programming and Model Checking. 

## Installation:  
### 1) Docker Image   
   * ```docker pull misbahch6/caspo-timeseries```  
     * To install Docker please follow this link: https://docs.docker.com/install/

### 2) Manually  
   * ```git clone https://github.com/misbahch6/caspo-ts.git```  
   * This will install necessary dependencies, except the caspo, gringo python module and NuSMV.
   * To install caspo please use:
     * ```conda install -c bioasp caspo```
        * To install anaconda please follow this link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
   * To install gringo python module please use:
     * ```conda install -c potassco clingo=4.5.4```
   * To install NuSMV please compile the sources or put the binaries in your /usr/local/bin
     * http://nusmv.fbk.eu

## Usage:  

Here we show fromat of the commands used by the caspo-ts.

### 1) Identify all Boolean Networks:
 
 ```python cli.py identify PKN.sif DATASET.csv RESULTS.csv```    
     
   The option --family all to compute all the BNs. The option --limit to specify the number of BNs.
   The option --true-positives invokes a model-checker (NuSMV) to ensure that only true positive BNs are returned. The true      positive rate is then displayed. If the PKN is not compatible with the data, the estimated difference of MSE with minimal    MSE is displayed.

### 2) MSE Calculation:
 
 ```python cli.py mse PKN.sif DATASET.csv```   
     
   The option --check-exacts invokes a model-checker (NuSMV) until it finds a BN and a trace with the estimated MSE: in such    a case, the displayed MSE is the actual minimal MSE of the PKN with respect to the dataset. Add --network to specify the resulting csv file.

### 3) Validation of Boolean Networks through Model Checker:
   
   ```python cli.py validate PKN.sif DATASET.csv RESULTS.csv``` 

### Note:
* PKN.sif is the SIF description of the PKN delimiting the domain of BNs, e.g.: benchmarks/1/pkn1_cmpr.sif  
* DATASET.csv is the MIDAS description of the multiplex dataset, e.g., benchmarks/1/dataset1_cmpr_bn_1.csv  
* RESULTS.csv is a CSV description of a set of Boolean Networks, as outputted by our python scripts.  
* python is the python interpreter in version 2.7.X. On some systems, you should use python2. 
* Datasets folder contains the DREAM 8 Challenge dataset.

## Example 1:

If you have installed docker image then start an interactive session by typing:  

```docker run -ti --entrypoint /bin/bash misbahch6/caspo-timeseries``` 

```cd /src```

The following command will store the set of Boolean Networks in result.csv.

```caspots identify pkn.sif dataset.csv result.csv```
```
start initial solving
initial solve took 0.475992202759
optimizations = [0]
begin enumeration
enumeration took 0.477589845657
54 solution(s) for the over-approximation
```
The following command will display minimum mse. 

```caspots mse pkn.sif dataset.csv --networks result.csv```
```
MSE_discrete = 0.155167584136
MSE_sample >= 0.155167584136
```
The following command will model check over-approximated BNs.

```caspots validate  pkn.sif dataset.csv result.csv```
```
54/54 true positives [rate: 100.00%]
```

## Example 2:

If you have installed docker image then start an interactive session by typing:  

```docker run -ti --entrypoint /bin/bash misbahch6/caspo-timeseries``` 

```cd /src```

Please ignore the above commands if you are already in the interactive session.

To idenfify 10 BNs for ```BT549``` Cell line:

```caspots identify datasets/Dream8/merge_hpn_cmpr_CS.sif datasets/Dream8/BT549Refined-remove-ready.csv result.csv --limit 10```

```
# start initial solving
# initial solve took 865.829895973
# optimizations = [0]
# begin enumeration
# enumeration took 12.5855491161
10 solution(s) for the over-approximation
```

The argument --limit can be used to specify the number of BNs.

To calculate MSE:

```caspots mse datasets/Dream8/merge_hpn_cmpr_CS.sif datasets/Dream8/BT549Refined-remove-ready.csv --networks result.csv```

```
MSE_discrete = 0.349898336884
MSE_sample >= 0.349898336884
```

To model check learned BNs:

```caspots validate datasets/Dream8/merge_hpn_cmpr_CS.sif datasets/Dream8/BT549Refined-remove-ready.csv result.csv```
